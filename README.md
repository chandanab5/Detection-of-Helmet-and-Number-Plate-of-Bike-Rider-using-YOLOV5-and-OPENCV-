# Detection-of-Helmet-and-Number-Plate-of-Bike-Rider-using-YOLOV5-and-OPENCV-

The proposed framework consists of two steps: Identification of the Helmet of the bike rider and then eventually the detection of the number plate of the vehicle non-helmet riders.  Number Plate Recognition is the most efficient and cost-effective method used for vehicle identification. We have concentrated on helmet detection at toll gates, while several researchers have created machine and deep learning-based helmet detection systems. We are using YOLO to train the dataset and perform detection in Colab.
